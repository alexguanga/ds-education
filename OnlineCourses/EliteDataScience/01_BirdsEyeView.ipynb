    "## Supervised VS. Unsupervised\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** includes tasks for \"labeled\" data (i.e. you have a target variable).\n",
    "    - In practice, it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.\n",
    "    - Each observation must be labeled with a \"correct answer.\"\n",
    "    - Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what's \"correct\" while training it (hence, \"supervising\" it).\n",
    "    - Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.\n",
    "    - Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. \"class\") target variables.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** includes tasks for \"unlabeled\" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).\n",
    "    - In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.\n",
    "    - Unlabeled data has no predetermined \"correct answer.\"\n",
    "    - You'll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without \"supervision\").\n",
    "    - Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data."
