    "- Making your ads seen: Now, those are a lot of factors! Your bid, the impact of ad formats you have enabled, your ad’s expected clickthrough rate (CTR), ad relevancy, and finally, the landing page experience when users click on your ad — these are all influential.\n",
    "- And to understand their influence, we’ll start by taking a look at the AdWords auction — the system responsible for taking all these factors into consideration and ultimately deciding your ad’s position and even whether it shows up at all.\n",
    "- The AdWords auction: The AdWords auction is the process that happens with each Google search. It decides which ads will appear for that specific search, which order those ads will show on the page, and how much the advertiser (that’s you!) will pay for that placement.\n",
    "- FACTORS:\n",
    "    - First there’s your bid amount. Not to be confused with the amount a click on your ad actually costs, this is the maximum amount you are willing to pay for a user to click on your ad and visit your site. To ensure good value for all, top bids don’t necessarily lead to top rank on the search results page. As it is becoming pretty clear by now, there are a number of other factors that the auction considers to make that determination! \n",
    "    - Expected clickthrough rate (CTR) is the prediction of how often your ad will get clicked when shown for a keyword. To determine this rate, AdWords takes into account how well your keyword has performed, that is, how users responded to your ad by clicking on it or not in the past.\n",
    "    - An ad is only useful if its landing page helps a user find what they’re looking for! A positive landing page experience: Includes relevant and original content that helps the user complete their task, Is easily navigable, Articulates your business clearly\n",
    "    - Ad relevancy is calculated by analyzing the language in your ad to determine how well it relates to the search query. Ad relevancy is a key factor in the auction process, enabling users to see only useful ads that are relevant to the search performed. \n",
    "    - Ad formats, like those that include various ad extensions, may influence rank as well. For example, using various ad extensions, like a sitelink to a page on your website, your address, or phone number, may serve to bolster your rank. \n",
    "- So how can you get a general sense of which ads might be of higher quality? \n",
    "- **One estimate is your Quality Score. Quality Score is the 1-10 rating that is reported for each keyword in your account calculated by estimating the quality of your ads and their associated landing pages. A high Quality Score means that our systems think your ad and landing page are relevant and useful to someone looking at your ad.** \n",
    "- Remember:\n",
    "    - Even if your competition bids higher than you, you can still win a higher position — at a lower price — with highly relevant keywords and ads.\n",
    "    - Auctions are ongoing for every search on Google — and each one can have potentially different results depending on the competition at that moment. So you may see fluctuation in your ad's position on the page and even whether your ad shows at all.\n",
    "- ** IMPORTANT FACTORS**: Bid, Quality, and Format Impact (like the ad extensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difference between Quality Score and Ad Rank:\n",
    "    -  Just remember that Ad Rank is influenced by three factors: your bid, available ad formats, and components of ad quality. Ad Rank matters because it determines your ad position (where ads appear on the page). In fact, it determines whether your ad will show at all.\n",
