    "- You break down the problem into some different portions\n",
    "- You first find way to categorize the data, say for people, there's a rectangle that probably means the ratio of the person\n",
    "- You then give it correct and wrong data examples that have the desired dimension\n",

    "- The expansion simply means that if we have a white pixel, then we color the entire distance btw. them white\n",
