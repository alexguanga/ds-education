    "- Error due to Bias: \n",
    "    - The error due to bias is taken as the difference between the expected (or average) prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Of course you only have one model so talking about expected or average prediction values might seem a little strange. However, imagine you could repeat the whole model building process more than once: each time you gather new data and run a new analysis creating a new model. Due to randomness in the underlying data sets, the resulting models will have a range of predictions. Bias measures how far off in general these models' predictions are from the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error due to Variance: \n",
    "    - The error due to variance is taken as the variability of a model prediction for a given data point. Again, imagine you can repeat the entire model building process multiple times. The variance is how much the predictions for a given point vary between different realizations of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Essentially, bias is how removed a model's predictions are from correctness, while variance is the degree to which these predictions vary between model iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Bias is the algorithm's tendency to consistently learn the wrong thing by not taking into account all the information in the data (underfitting).\n",
    "- Variance is the algorithm's tendency to learn random things irrespective of the real signal by fitting highly flexible models that follow the error/noise in the data too closely (overfitting).\n",

    "### True Error VS. Residuals:\n",
    "In statistics and optimization, errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its \"theoretical value\". The error (or disturbance) of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean).
