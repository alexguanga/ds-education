    "### Choose where customers see your ads\n",
    "-  The Google Network is made up of two networks: Search and Display. They're the places where your AdWords ads can appear, including: Google sites, partner sites, and other placements like mobile phone apps.\n",
    "- On the Search Network, your ads may appear on:\n",
    "     - Google Search, Google Shopping, Google Maps, and Google Play.\n",
    "     - Search sites that partner with Google.\n",
    "- On the Display Network, your ads may appear on:\n",
    "     - Google sites like YouTube, Blogger, and Gmail.\n",
    "     - Partnering websites across the internet.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- The Google Network can connect you with customers at the exact moment they're engaged in an online activity connected to what you offer — like searching for your product, reading a blog about your industry, or watching a related video on YouTube. Choosing the correct ad format for your campaign can ensure your ad is the most relevant and actionable for a particular customer at that moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ads Format\n",
    "    - **Text Ads**: The most common kind of Search ad includes a descriptive headline, website URL, and descriptive text like a call to action.\n",
    "        - Search Network\n",
    "        - Search Partners\n",
    "    - **Ads with extensions**: Ad extensions provide additional information to your text ad, such as your business’s address or phone number.\n",
    "        - Search Network\n",
    "        - Display Network (depending on the extension) \n",
    "    - **Responsive ads**: The Display Network offers ads that adjust to match the pages and apps that show them. Viewers are more likely to see these ads because they blend in with the content the viewers came for. Responsive ads can go a long way to help build awareness, influence consideration, and drive action.\n",
    "        - Display Network  \n",
    "    - **Shopping ads**: In addition to an image, Shopping ads contain product and pricing information, so users get a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click your ad. They’re ideal if you’re managing a large inventory of products.\n",
    "        - Google Shopping (in select countries)\n",
    "        - Google Search\n",
    "        - Google Search Partner websites, including YouTube and Image Search in some countries (if your campaign is set to include search partners)\n",
    "    - **Image ads**: Image ads capture people's attention as they browse websites in the Google Display Network.\n",
    "        - Search Network - *Image ads show on search partner networks, but not the Google Search Network.*\n",
    "        - Display Network\n",
    "    - **Video ads**: Video ads are just what they sound like — a standalone video ad or a video ad that runs inside another streaming video.\n",
    "        - Search Network - *Image ads show on search partner networks, but not the Google Search Network.*\n",
    "        - Display Network\n",
    "    - **Add Promotional ads**: App promotion ads send your customers to an app store to download your app, or include a deep link directly into your app.\n",
    "        - Search Network \n",
    "        - Display Network\n",
    "    - **Call-only ads**: Call-only ads allow your customers to call your business directly by clicking on your ad. They’re useful for driving phone calls to your business from devices that can make calls.\n",
    "        - Search Network\n",
    "    - **Rich media ads**: Rich media ads are engaging ad formats that often include animation or other types of motion.\n",

    "### Choose effective text ads\n",
    "- Text ads are just that — ads made up of text. They are a simple yet powerful way to get your business in front of customers right when they are searching for products or services like yours on the Google Search Network. Here’s an example\n",
    "- Only three parts are required for all text ads: headline, URL, and description. Others are optional. Let’s take a closer look.\n",
    "- Writing effective text ads: To effectively reach potential customers, your text ads should be specific, actionable, and relevant. Let’s take a closer look at things to keep in mind when writing text ads. \n",
    "- Best practices:\n",
    "    - Headlines matter...a lot. People are most likely to read the headline of your ad, so even though you have extra room now, you still need to make every word count.\n",
    "    - Also, when viewed on the search results page, your ad’s headline fields are combined using a hyphen, “-”. On mobile, the headline may wrap beyond the first line, so consider how this will read to ensure it’s a compelling experience. \n",
    "    - Direct users to pages of your site that deliver a great experience through mobile-specific URLs.\n",
    "    - And if you know about any calls to action or offers that work particularly well on mobile devices, take advantage of ad customizers to speak directly to those mobile users.\n",
    "    - Including information below your ad, like additional deep links into your website or business location, has been shown to increase your ad’s performance. \n",
    "    - When it comes to making that ad super effective, it’s not all about what’s in the ad itself ...let’s not forget about your landing page experience! Landing page experience is AdWords’ measure of how well your website gives people who click your ads exactly what they’re looking for — quickly and effortlessly."

    "### Enhance your ad with extensions\n",
    "- Why extensions? Extensions expand your ad with additional information—giving people more reasons to choose your business. Extension formats include call buttons, location information, additional links, additional text, and more.\n",
    "- **Sitelink extensions**: Link people directly to specific pages of your website (like “hours” and “order now”).\n",
    "- **Callout extensions**: Add additional text to your ad, like “free delivery” or “24/7 customer support.”\n",
    "- **Structured snippets**: Highlight specific aspects of your products and services. They show underneath your text ad on search in the form of a header (ex: \"Destinations\") and list (ex: \"Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Africa\").\n",
    "- **Location extensions**: Encourage people to visit your business by showing your location, a call button, and a link to your business details page—which can include your hours, photos of your business, and directions to get there.\n",
    "- **Call extensions**: Encourage people to call your business by adding a phone number or call button to your ads.\n",
    "- **Message extensions**: Encourage people to send you text messages from your ad. Available globally at the campaign or ad group levels.\n",
    "- **Price extensions**: Showcase your services or product categories with their prices, so that people can browse your products right from your ad.\n",
    "- **Promotion extensions**: Highlight specific sales and promotions across your ads (e.g., 30% off rose bouquets) \n",
    "- **App extensions**: Available globally for Android and iOS mobile devices, including tablets. \n",
    "- Seller ratings next to her ad to highlight how highly regarded Fareena’s shop is by her customers. These are called automated extensions.\n",
    "- When do extensions show up? Adding an extension doesn’t mean it will show with your ad all the time. AdWords selects which extensions to show in response to each individual search on Google.\n",
    "- Extensions show with your ad when:\n",
    "    - The extension (or combination of extensions) is predicted to improve your performance.\n",
    "    - Your ad’s position and Ad Rank is high enough for extensions to show. To show extensions, AdWords requires a minimum Ad Rank. Unsure what this Ad Rank is all about? Sit tight, and we’ll cover it later in AdWords Basics. "

    "### Choosing the best campaigns types\n",
    "-  AdWords campaign types: Advertising with AdWords starts with creating a campaign. The type of campaign you choose to create should be based on your advertising goals. The campaign type determines where customers will be able to see your ads, but you’ll have the chance to make this more specific with additional settings.\n",
    "- In a Search campaign, your ads can appear near Google search results and other Google sites when people search for terms that are relevant to your ad’s keywords. This campaign type is useful for advertisers who want to show their text ads to high-potential customers right when they’re searching for related products or services.\n",
    "- With a Display Network campaign, your ads can appear throughout the Google Display Network. This campaign type works by matching your ads to websites or mobile apps that include content that's related to your business or to your customers' interests. You can set up targeting to match your ads to the most relevant Display Network sites based on their topics, interested audiences, demographics, and more. This campaign type is useful for advertisers who want to generate awareness of their business and target audiences with specific interests across the web.\n",
    "- When you create a Search campaign, you’ll have the option to select “Display opt-in”. This selection allows you to show your ads on the search results page of the Google Search Network and relevant placements on the Display Network. With this option, you only need to create search ads and those run seamlessly across both the Search and Display networks. This type allows you to expand your potential audience. Your ads can reach people as they browse or research similar products, whether they're looking on Google Search or on a relevant website.\n",
    "- With a Video campaign type you can run video ads on YouTube and on sites across the Google Display Network. This type allows you to engage customers in different ways on YouTube and across video partner sites. Available video ad formats include: TrueView in-stream ads, TrueView video discovery ads, and bumper ads.\n",
    "- With a Shopping campaign type, you might see your ads in Google Shopping, next to search results, and near text and responsive ads. They can also show up on Google Search partner websites like YouTube. This campaign type is useful for retailers who want to promote their online and local inventory, boost traffic to their website or local store, and find better qualified leads.\n",
    "- With a Universal app campaign type, you can easily promote your app across Search, Display, and YouTube. Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads for your app. All you need to do is provide some text, a starting bid and budget, and include the languages and geographic locations for your ads. Our system will then test different combinations and show the best-performing ads more often. "

You can target those who actively intend to purchase your products and personalize your ads with relevant messages. All thanks to machine learning.\n",
    "    - Another aspect of targeting focuses on “WHERE” your audience is. “WHERE” can refer to where your customers are in the physical world (e.g., location and device targeting) or where they are online (e.g., contextual or topic targeting).\n",
    "    - The final aspect of targeting focuses on “WHAT” is of interest to your audience. With AdWords, you can specify keywords based on what people are searching for.

    "### Make your ads seen\n",
    "- Making your ads seen: Now, those are a lot of factors! Your bid, the impact of ad formats you have enabled, your ad’s expected clickthrough rate (CTR), ad relevancy, and finally, the landing page experience when users click on your ad — these are all influential.\n",
    "- And to understand their influence, we’ll start by taking a look at the AdWords auction — the system responsible for taking all these factors into consideration and ultimately deciding your ad’s position and even whether it shows up at all.\n",
    "- The AdWords auction: The AdWords auction is the process that happens with each Google search. It decides which ads will appear for that specific search, which order those ads will show on the page, and how much the advertiser (that’s you!) will pay for that placement.\n",
    "- FACTORS:\n",
    "    - First there’s your bid amount. Not to be confused with the amount a click on your ad actually costs, this is the maximum amount you are willing to pay for a user to click on your ad and visit your site. To ensure good value for all, top bids don’t necessarily lead to top rank on the search results page. As it is becoming pretty clear by now, there are a number of other factors that the auction considers to make that determination! \n",
    "    - Expected clickthrough rate (CTR) is the prediction of how often your ad will get clicked when shown for a keyword. To determine this rate, AdWords takes into account how well your keyword has performed, that is, how users responded to your ad by clicking on it or not in the past.\n",
    "    - An ad is only useful if its landing page helps a user find what they’re looking for! A positive landing page experience: Includes relevant and original content that helps the user complete their task, Is easily navigable, Articulates your business clearly\n",
    "    - Ad relevancy is calculated by analyzing the language in your ad to determine how well it relates to the search query. Ad relevancy is a key factor in the auction process, enabling users to see only useful ads that are relevant to the search performed. \n",
    "    - Ad formats, like those that include various ad extensions, may influence rank as well. For example, using various ad extensions, like a sitelink to a page on your website, your address, or phone number, may serve to bolster your rank. \n",
    "- So how can you get a general sense of which ads might be of higher quality? \n",
    "- **One estimate is your Quality Score. Quality Score is the 1-10 rating that is reported for each keyword in your account calculated by estimating the quality of your ads and their associated landing pages. A high Quality Score means that our systems think your ad and landing page are relevant and useful to someone looking at your ad.** \n",
    "- Remember:\n",
    "    - Even if your competition bids higher than you, you can still win a higher position — at a lower price — with highly relevant keywords and ads.\n",
    "    - Auctions are ongoing for every search on Google — and each one can have potentially different results depending on the competition at that moment. So you may see fluctuation in your ad's position on the page and even whether your ad shows at all.\n",

    "- **CPA**: Pay only if a user sees an ad on the publisher’s site and later makes a purchase or completes some other desired action on your website.

    "    - Manual bidding is where you control the bidding yourself. Automated, is where you let AdWords do the heavy lifting for you. Let’s take a closer look at each and then dig in on how to pick the best strategy for your business.\n",
    "- **Manual bidding**: Manual bidding lets you manually set bids at the ad group level, for individual keywords, or for ad placements, so you know you're bidding for the clicks that mean the most to you.\n",
    "- **Automated bidding**: With automated bidding you can set a daily budget and then have AdWords automatically adjust your bids to get the most clicks or conversions possible within your budget.\n",
    "- **Different Goals**:\n",
    "    - Goal: Build awareness. Focusing on impressions may be your strategy. You can use cost per thousand viewable impressions (vCPM) or cost per view (CPV) bidding to put your message in front of customers.\n",
    "    - Goal: Drive web visits. Focusing on clicks could be ideal for you. Cost-per-click (CPC) bidding—manual or automatic—may be right for your campaign.\n",
    "    - Goal: Drive online sales. It may be best to implement conversion tracking in your campaign and focus on conversions. Cost-per-acquisition (CPA) bidding lets you do just that.\n",
    "- Most people starting out in AdWords use cost-per-click (CPC) bidding. With this option, you set a maximum cost-per-click bid that's the highest amount you're willing to pay for a click on your ad. Set your bid by thinking about how much an ad click is worth to you. You can figure this out based on what you know about your business and the value of a sale. \n",
    "- **3 tools to determine your CPC bids:**\n",
    "    - **Bid simulator**: Bid simulator runs \"what-if\" scenarios like, How many more impressions would I have gotten if my bid had been 0.10 higher last week?\n",
    "    - **Keyword Planner**: Keyword Planner shows you how often some keywords get searched, and gives you cost estimates at a glance.\n",
    "    - **First-page bid estimates** First-page bid estimates helps you see how much you may need to bid to put your ad on the first page of Google search results.\n",
    "- What keywords lead to the most clicks on your ads?\n",
    "    - To see how many clicks you’re getting per keyword and how much they cost, go to the “keywords” tab in your account. Try filtering your keywords by click-through rate to see which keywords get you a lot of impressions, but few clicks. If your goal is to generate sales, these are the keywords that are probably not working so well. \n",
    "- How do I increase my ROI?\n",
    "     - Once you’ve identified which keywords, locations, times, and devices are getting good results, you can adjust your bids accordingly. For instance, if a keyword has a low average CPC but each click converts well, you may try increasing its max CPC bid. This could improve the ad’s average position for that keyword, giving your ads more exposure and potentially increasing your ROI.\n",
