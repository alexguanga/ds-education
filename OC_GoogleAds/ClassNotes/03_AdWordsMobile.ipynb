    "    - AdWords ads can show any time by default, but you can also serve them at specific times. For example, if you're advertising for a restaurant that is only open from 11 a.m.-11 p.m., you may want to create ads promoting a walk-in discount that will only show during the 11 a.m.-11 p.m. timeframe. \n",

    "- **Adjust bids by device manually** \n",
    "    - Mobile ad views are often worth more to you for particular devices, locations, or times, so AdWords lets you adjust your bids to be visible when customers are looking for you. \n",
    "- **Call bid adjustments**\n",
    "    - Call bid adjustments help drive more calls by setting a bid multiplier on call clicks. You can bid higher or lower on call clicks and determine how much you are willing to pay for a call versus a standard click.\n",
    "    - We want to make sure our call button shows whenever it’s eligible, so we’ll use Google’s “Interaction coverage” metric to see the percent of times our ads showed with a call button\n",

    "    - Smart Bidding is a set of conversion-based bid strategies — Target cost per acquisition (tCPA), Target return on ad spend (tROAS) and Enhanced cost per click (eCPC)\n",
    "    - We recommend that advertisers have at least 30 conversions in the past 30 days before using Target CPA. We recommend 50 conversions in the past 30 days for Target ROAS.\n",

    "    - **Target cost-per-acquisition** \n",

    "        - Enhanced cost-per-click bidding looks for ad auctions that are more likely to lead to conversions and raises your max manual bid to compete harder for them. \n",
    "        - If a click seems less likely to convert, eCPC will automatically lower your bid by as much as 100 percent.\n",
