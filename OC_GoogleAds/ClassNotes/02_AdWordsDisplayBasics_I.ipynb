    "### Determine a good bidding strategy\n",
    "- Two ways of bidding:\n",
    "    - Manual bidding is where you control the bidding yourself. Automated, is where you let AdWords do the heavy lifting for you. Let’s take a closer look at each and then dig in on how to pick the best strategy for your business.\n",
    "- **Manual bidding**: Manual bidding lets you manually set bids at the ad group level, for individual keywords, or for ad placements, so you know you're bidding for the clicks that mean the most to you.\n",
    "- **Automated bidding**: With automated bidding you can set a daily budget and then have AdWords automatically adjust your bids to get the most clicks or conversions possible within your budget.\n",
    "- **Different Goals**:\n",
    "    - Goal: Build awareness. Focusing on impressions may be your strategy. You can use cost per thousand viewable impressions (vCPM) or cost per view (CPV) bidding to put your message in front of customers.\n",
    "    - Goal: Drive web visits. Focusing on clicks could be ideal for you. Cost-per-click (CPC) bidding—manual or automatic—may be right for your campaign.\n",
    "    - Goal: Drive online sales. It may be best to implement conversion tracking in your campaign and focus on conversions. Cost-per-acquisition (CPA) bidding lets you do just that.\n",
    "- Most people starting out in AdWords use cost-per-click (CPC) bidding. With this option, you set a maximum cost-per-click bid that's the highest amount you're willing to pay for a click on your ad. Set your bid by thinking about how much an ad click is worth to you. You can figure this out based on what you know about your business and the value of a sale. \n",
    "- **3 tools to determine your CPC bids:**\n",
    "    - **Bid simulator**: Bid simulator runs \"what-if\" scenarios like, How many more impressions would I have gotten if my bid had been 0.10 higher last week?\n",
    "    - **Keyword Planner**: Keyword Planner shows you how often some keywords get searched, and gives you cost estimates at a glance.\n",
    "    - **First-page bid estimates** First-page bid estimates helps you see how much you may need to bid to put your ad on the first page of Google search results.\n",
    "- What keywords lead to the most clicks on your ads?\n",
    "    - To see how many clicks you’re getting per keyword and how much they cost, go to the “keywords” tab in your account. Try filtering your keywords by click-through rate to see which keywords get you a lot of impressions, but few clicks. If your goal is to generate sales, these are the keywords that are probably not working so well. \n",
    "- How do I increase my ROI?\n",
    "     - Once you’ve identified which keywords, locations, times, and devices are getting good results, you can adjust your bids accordingly. For instance, if a keyword has a low average CPC but each click converts well, you may try increasing its max CPC bid. This could improve the ad’s average position for that keyword, giving your ads more exposure and potentially increasing your ROI."

    "### Select your bid strategy\n",
    "- **How automated bidding works**\n",
    "    - Your keyword list determines which searches and site visits can trigger your ad if you win the bid, but the \"right\" bid for an impression can be a moving target influenced by things like match type, device, and location.\n",
    "    - With automated bidding, AdWords can automatically increase bids for impressions that it predicts (from auction-time data) could be more successful. \n",
    "- **When to use manual bidding**\n",
    "    - You don’t have enough conversions to meet the recommendations for automated bidding\n",
    "    - You need 100 percent control of how you pay for views, clicks or conversions\n",
    "- **How to choose your automated bidding strategy**\n",
    "    - Ad clicks: Maximize clicks automatically sets your bids to help get as many clicks as possible within your budget. It can increase site visits and increase clicks on low-traffic terms.\n",
    "    - Ad revenue: Target return-on-ad-spend (ROAS) bids more where AdWords estimates ads are more likely to lead to a sale — aiming to get as much return on ad spend as possible.\n",
    "    - Ad conversions: Automated bidding strategies designed to generate conversions include Enhanced cost per click (ECPC), Maximize conversions and Target cost per acquisition (CPA). We’ll dive into each of these in the following section.\n",
    "- **Which automated conversion bidding type is right for you?**\n",
    "    - **Enhanced cost per click (ECPC)** is a semi-automated bid strategy which adjusts your bids to get you as many conversions as possible, within your determined budget. You set keyword bids and let AdWords work its magic to improve your campaign’s performance. *Good for advertisers looking for an incremental increase in conversions while still retaining control over their keyword bids.*\n",
    "    - **Maximize conversions** bidding automatically sets bids at auction time to get you as much conversion volume as possible within your campaign’s budget. *Good for those with a fixed advertising budget already seeing at least 15 conversions and 15 clicks per month, who do not know how much they should be willing to pay for a conversion (in other words, they do not have a target CPA).*\n",
    "    - **Target CPA** automatically sets bids to help get as many conversions as possible at the target CPA you set (some conversions may cost more or less than your target). Target CPA does not operate within a set budget. *Good for advertisers who know how much they’re willing to pay for a conversion and prioritize maintaining a specific cost per conversion over driving conversion volume.*"

These ads can be used to meet a variety of advertising goals. Once someone expands your ad, the additional clicks on your content are free.\n",
    "- **Three things to remember about ad formats**\n",
    "    - Ad formats, like responsive ads, image ads, TrueView ads, universal app campaigns, and Gmail ads, can be used to achieve goals across the funnel. Your messaging and calls to action in your ads will impact the goals that you want to achieve. \n",
    "    - The way you bid on an ad format can change the goal that that ad format achieves.\n",
    "    - All of the ad formats in this course can run on mobile devices, so you can reach customers while they are on the go across mobile web and in mobile apps."

    "- **How to improve your results with performance data**\n",
    "    - You can use the data AdWords collects while your campaign is running to see what's getting results. \n",
    "- **Display performance metrics for driving action**\n",
    "    - How effective are your Display ads at driving action? You can see for yourself in AdWords by looking at a combination of conversions, view-through conversions, and conversion delays. If your ad views and clicks aren’t leading to results, it may be time to refresh your ads, targeting, landing page, or all three. If your goal is conversions you should use target cost-per-acquisition (CPA) bidding to get more conversions for your budget. Let’s take a closer look at these metrics, and at target CPA bidding.\n",
    "    - Conversions:\n",
    "        - How many customers converted after clicking on your ad? Conversions show you how well your ads and site are working together to drive action. (Just ensure conversion tracking is on in AdWords so you can see this data.)\n",
    "    - Target cost per acquisition (CPA)\n",
    "        - How much do you want to spend for each conversion? Cost per acquisition is the average amount you pay for a conversion. If your goal is to get the most conversions for your budget, you should use an automated bid strategy based on your target CPA. It’s recommended that you use a 30-day historical CPA.\n",
    "    - View-through conversions (VTCs)\n",
    "        - How many customers could see your ad and converted on your site without clicking the ad? A VTC is triggered whenever a user is on the Display Network and sees your ad, but does not click on it. The user later directly visits your website or finds it via an organic search or other referring site (basically any source other than Google/AdWords).\n",

    "    - Reach: Ad reach is an estimate of the number of people who see your ad. It’s a great metric for measuring how well you’re doing against your goal of building brand awareness.\n",
    "    - Frequency: Frequency is an estimate of the average number of times a unique cookie was exposed to your ad over a given time period.\n",
    "- **Improve target audience results**\n",
    "    - Your AdWords Display campaigns show targeting performance for each of your targeting methods (Keywords, Audiences, Demographics, Topics, Placements). Identify the targeting methods that perform best based on your goals and update to replace poor performers with proven performers. \n",
    "- **How to troubleshoot Display campaigns**\n",
    "    - If a Display campaign encounters issues, AdWords provides notifications in “Status review”. To get his ads up and running, Sam will want to address these issues and make any necessary corrections. Let’s take a look at how Sam handles some of these notifications.\n",
    "    - Ads not serving:\n",
    "        - His targeting is too restrictive for ads to serve\n",
    "        - His ads aren’t running because some of them have been disapproved\n",
    "        - His bids are too low for his ads to run \n",
    "    - Incompatible targeting\n",
    "        - Gmail ads aren't compatible with custom affinity audiences, remarketing, and remarketing-based similar audiences\n",
    "        - Gmail ads are compatible with Customer Match, but they can only run on mail.google.com\n",
    "    - Remarketing tags and feeds\n",
    "        - For tagging: the tag activity has dropped or the tag has errors in the HTML code\n",
    "        - For feeds: the items in the feed have been disapproved\n",
    "- **Optimize for success: responsive ads**\n",
    "    - Sam wants his ads to appear wherever they can across the Display Network, wherever ad space is available. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the the design team to be able to deliver creatives in a variety of sizes and formats on-demand. Instead of hiring a huge team, Sam can simply create responsive ads. Let’s follow along as he creates his first one.\n",
    "- **Optimize for success: automated bidding**\n",
    "    - Target cost per acquisition (CPA) automatically sets Display bids to help get as many conversions as possible at the target CPA Sam sets.\n",
    "    - If Sam wants to automate while still maintaining control over the cost-per-click (CPC) bids, he can use Enhanced cost per click (ECPC) to automatically adjust his manual bids. This helps him get 10 percent more conversions on average, while trying to achieve the same cost per conversion as he got on Manual CPC.\n",
    "    - If Sam values his various conversions at different rates, he can use Target ROAS to automatically set bids to get as much conversion value as possible at the target ROAS he sets. He’ll need to import his conversion values in order to use it.\n",
    "    - Maximize Clicks automatically sets bids to help Sam get as many clicks as possible within his budget.\n",
    "- Targeting optimization works best for advertisers looking to:\n",
    "    - Find more customers\n",
    "    - Identify the best targeting to reach their most likely customers\n",
    "    - Increase reach without increasing bids or cost per customer\n",
    "-  Conservative automatic targeting applies a lightweight expansion that’s similar to his existing targeting. Aggressive automatic targeting applies a much broader expansion in order to explore additional inventory. Both types can help him reach additional customers, but aggressive targeting brings Sam more customers at a slightly higher CPA.\n",
    "- Sam would choose conservative targeting when he wants more conversions, but needs to stay close to his current cost per customer (or target CPA). This would be the better option if he had a fixed or limited budget.\n",
    "- He would choose aggressive targeting when he wants to get as many conversions as possible and is comfortable with some variation from his current cost per customer (or target CPA/ROAS).\n",
    "- Sam also has the option to use highly automated Smart display campaigns, which use yet another type of automated targeting, combining contextual and audience-based targeting. They also automatically remarket to people who've recently visited his site and who are likely to convert.\n",
