    "- The biggest contributer in the economy is the government. There are twonways the government influences (the central government which collects taxes and spends money), the central bank controls the amount of money and credit in the economy. It does by influecing  interest rate and printing money\n",

    "- When people are handed money, people will spend more which will provide more purchasing in the economy\n",
